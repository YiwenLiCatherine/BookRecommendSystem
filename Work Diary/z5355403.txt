Name: Rudy Ginardy Lie

Week 1
- Group formed, contacts exchanged, Teams setup, project decided. 
- Discussed with the team about each team member's individual abilities, experience and technical backgrounds.
- I created the Jira & GitHub accounts. 
- I created a form on When2meet to record everyone's availability for meeting. We scheduled 2 general group meetings every week.
- I setup a template for product backlog and sprint planning, and together with Yiwen Li, I wrote the user story and sprints section of the proposal.
- I discussed with the team all available software tools and libraries that we can use for the project.
- I researched suitable machine learning algorithms, listed possible training dataset and techniques involved to build the recommender system feature of the project.
- I initiated discussion on the 2 novel functionalities for the project, and suggested several ideas for the novel functionalities.

Week 2
- I initiated the discussion on assigning prioritisation and story points of each user stories 
- I finalised sprint plans, assigning the user stories to 5 sprints and together with Yiwen, I devised a backup plan in case of task delays during the sprint
- I researched the workflow of a recommender system and how it can be connected with the rest of the application
- Together with Pruthvi, I created the end to end machine learning workflow diagram
- I initiated the discussion and suggested novel functionalities for the application 

Week 3
- Finalised the user stories and sprint plan as per tutor's suggestions and finalised the third major part of the report
- Started the development of the machine learning model used in the recommender system
- Together with Pruthvi, planned how to integrate the backend system and the developed machine learning model
- Researched the best approach to tackle the cold start problem in the recommender system

Week 4
- Explored the dataset used for training the recommender system
- Developed data cleaning methods, joined the datasets and preprocessed the dataset for training
- Developed the scoring system based on the existing researches to rank the popularity of the books by taking into account the average ratings and the number of ratings
- Together with Pruthvi, developed how to efficiently query the most popular books (i.e. without having to re-calculate the score for each of 10000 books every time user logs in)
- Developed the content based recommender system to find the most similar books given a book. Also added methods to add the necessary variation to the book recommendations so that the user could explore other types of books.
- Explored and compared the performance of different similarity measurements and NLP methods (i.e. vectorizers such as TF-IDF Vectorizers and CountVectorizer)
- Assisted Jinyu with the frontend side of user story #41

Week 5
- Started developing the collaborative filtering algorithm to generate user based recommendations.
- Developed data cleaning and preprocessing methods for the collaborative filtering algorithm
- Explored the most efficient way to preprocess the user input and incorporate it into the sparse dataset
- Along with the team, contributed to the retrospective A meeting and wrote the retrospective A report

Week 6
- Wrote the test scenarios for front end testing in sprint 2
- Together with Pruthvi, implemented the collaborative filtering algorithm to the backend
- Wrote frontend code to show several distinct lists of book recommendations obtained using 3 different ML algorithms
- Helped Jinyu fixing the issues in the book recommendation cards that was previously pointed out by the tutor in week 5 demo

Week 7
- Tuned the collaborative filtering algorithm for better recommendations
- Tuned the content filtering algorithm for better recommendations
- Implemented the content based filtering algorithm to the backend
- Added code to filter out book recommendations that have been rated by the user
- Fixed bugs in multiple backend routes that arises when retrieving collections and ratings for new users
- Fixed CORS policy issue in the backend
- Implemented frontend code to show main collection in the dashboard
- Designed logo for the website
- Assisted Yiwen and Jinyu in debugging issues in pages related to search and user collections

Week 8
- Together with Yiwen, built the feature to search books by title and author
- Fixed UI design for Navbar
- Fixed UI design for dashboard
- Fixed several bugs related to showing collections
- Added feature for users to see the other user's collection

Week 9
- Implemented user information page
- Implemented follow and unfollow page in the frontend side
- Fixed bugs in the backend when the to be followed/unfollowed user does not exist
- Assisted Yiwen in fixing bugs where user does not exist in the leaderboard
- Started the report and defined the report format

Week 10
- Finalised the final report
- Fixed several very minor bugs in the frontend
- Tested, and prepared the code to be ready to be submitted
