Book recomendation engine link -- https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-content-based-book-recommendation-engine-9fd4d57a4da

Week 1

We all introduced ourselves and started discussing about which project to takeup from the given options.
We finally decided to take up Book Recomendation System. 
I started looking into multiple options for Database, Azure, Elastc Search or SQL RDBMS.
In our first lab we created all the requirements given by lab incharge. 
Also Decided to Look for a Data Set, which can be used for training the recomendation engine.


Week 2
I found the data set from the link mentioned in the link above. We finalised on the data set. 
We also finalised on going with no-sql database. We have decided to go ahed with elastic search because it is really fast
and cheap.
We will be using the cloud version of Elastic search.
We discussed about the sprint plan and scored each task discussing among ourselfs. 
I designed the draft version of two System Architectures and formulated design to store user and book data in elastic search.


week 3
- started desinigning schema for Elastic search and set up the envirinment for the elastic search. 
- explained elastic search and capabelities to teamates.
- explained how back-end will be connected to front end.
- started coding in python using flask for all the basic api's.
- designed and planned ML pipeling and its intigration with backend with rudy. Mainly for cold start.

week 4
- Stared writing apis to connect elastic search and front end for all the features in the sprint.
- Api's were written for all the buttons in the fontend. 
- With rudy, we implemented a pipeline to get the top 20 books from the dataset and wrote an api to fetech the top 20 books for the dataset. 
- choose elastic search cosine similarity to do similarity search. 
- Completed all the apis for the front-end team and for the sprint. 

week 5
- We all presented our project in the Demo A and got valuable feedback from the tutor.
- i immidiately started working on the requirements of the tutor. 
- we had our retrospective meeting online in teams and exchanged our views and oppinions. we had a very productive meeting and felt more confident about the next sprint. 
- i am working paralelly with sprint 1 requirements and sprint 2 requirements also. 
- Completed the week with retrospective meeting, discussing with the teammates 

week 6
- implemented the collaborative filtering algorithm to the backend
- Completed all the required APIs and testing the APis completely and suported the team with backend.
- Researched Multiple ways to add to Recomendation engine using elastit search's featires. 

week 7
- completed all sprint APIS and requirements. 
- fixed cors issue faced in the frontend.
- added content based filtering api from rudys code.
- developed apis for current sprint. like collection follow etc.

week 8
- desined apis for all the remaining functionalitys
- designed elaborate scoring metric for the users and proposed to team.
- cross checked buggs and edge cases for all the apis written so far.
- fixed to simpler scoring metric for scoring users after discussion with team.

week 9
- made changes to the search user functinality.
- cross checked all the apis and started with commenting the code, code cleanup

week 10
- fixed bug in collections and added additional checks for that function.
- finished documentation.
- finished practicing for final demo. 
- succesfully finished final demo.
